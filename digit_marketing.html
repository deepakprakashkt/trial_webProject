Five areas, which are outlined as current industry practices that are often ineffective are prioritizing clicks, balancing search and display, understanding mobiles, targeting, viewability, brand safety and invalid traffic, and cross-platform measurement.<sup id="cite_ref-Whiteside-2016_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteside-2016-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Why these practices are ineffective and some ways around making these aspects effective are discussed surrounding the following points.
    </p>
    <div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Prioritizing_clicks">Prioritizing clicks</h3></div>
    <p>Prioritizing clicks refers to display click ads, although advantageous by being ‘simple, fast and inexpensive’ rates for display ads in 2016 is only 0.10 percent in the United States. This means one in a thousand click ads is relevant therefore having little effect. This displays that marketing companies should not just use click ads to evaluate the effectiveness of display advertisements.<sup id="cite_ref-Whiteside-2016_64-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteside-2016-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
    </p>
    <div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Balancing_search_and_display">Balancing search and display</h3></div>
    <p>Balancing search and display for digital display ads is important. marketers tend to look at the last search and attribute all of the effectiveness of this. This, in turn, disregards other marketing efforts, which establish brand value within the consumer's mind. <a href="/wiki/Comscore" title="Comscore">ComScore</a> determined through drawing on data online, produced by over one hundred multichannel retailers that digital display marketing poses strengths when compared with or positioned alongside, paid search.<sup id="cite_ref-Whiteside-2016_64-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteside-2016-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> This is why it is advised that when someone clicks on a display ad the company opens a landing page, not its home page. A landing page typically has something to draw the customer in to search beyond this page. Commonly marketers see increased sales among people exposed to a search ad. But the fact of how many people you can reach with a display campaign compared to a search campaign should be considered.  Multichannel retailers have an increased reach if the display is considered in synergy with search campaigns. Overall, both search and display aspects are valued as display campaigns build awareness for the brand so that more people are likely to click on these digital ads when running a search campaign.<sup id="cite_ref-Whiteside-2016_64-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteside-2016-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

    <div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3 id="Understanding_Mobiles">Understanding Mobiles</h3></div>

This may be difficult as ‘half the time spent on smartphone apps occurs on the individuals single most used app, and almost 85% of their time on the top four rated apps’.<sup id="cite_ref-Whiteside-2016_64-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteside-2016-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Mobile advertising can assist in achieving a variety of commercial objectives and it is effective due to taking over the entire screen, and voice or status is likely to be considered highly. However, the message must not be seen or thought of as intrusive.<sup id="cite_ref-Whiteside-2016_64-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteside-2016-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>  Disadvantages of digital media used on mobile devices also include limited creative capabilities, and reach.

    <p>The number of marketing channels continues to expand, as measurement practices are growing in complexity. A cross-platform view must be used to unify audience measurement and media planning. Market researchers need to understand how the Omni-channel affects consumer's behavior, although when advertisements are on a consumer's device this does not get measured. Significant aspects to cross-platform measurement involve deduplication and understanding that you have reached an incremental level with another platform, rather than delivering more impressions against people that have previously been reached.<sup id="cite_ref-Whiteside-2016_64-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteside-2016-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> An example is ‘ESPN and comScore partnered on Project Blueprint discovering the sports broadcaster achieved a 21% increase in unduplicated daily reach thanks to digital advertising’.<sup id="cite_ref-Whiteside-2016_64-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteside-2016-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Television and radio industries are the electronic media, which competes with digital and other technological advertising. Yet television advertising is not directly competing with online digital advertising due to being able to cross platform with digital technology.

Many ads are not seen by a consumer and may never reach the right demographic segment. Brand safety is another issue of whether or not the ad was produced in the context of being unethical or having offensive content. Recognizing fraud when an ad is exposed is another challenge marketers face. This relates to invalid traffic as premium sites are more effective at detecting fraudulent traffic, although non-premium sites are more so the problem.<sup id="cite_ref-Whiteside-2016_64-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteside-2016-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

This is due to a lack of reliability in terms of affiliates that can produce the demanded number of new customers. As a result of this risk and bad affiliates, it leaves the brand prone to exploitation in terms of claiming commission that isn't honestly acquired. Legal means may offer some protection against this, yet there are limitations in recovering any losses or investment. Despite this, affiliate marketing allows the brand to market towards smaller publishers and websites with smaller traffic. Brands that choose to use this marketing often should beware of such risks involved and look to associate with affiliates in which rules are laid down between the parties involved to assure and minimize the risk involved.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>70<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup></li>

It is also a way to rapidly communicate a message such as their value proposition to existing or potential customers. Yet this channel of communication may be perceived by recipients to be bothersome and irritating especially to new or potential customers, therefore the success of email marketing is reliant on the language and visual appeal applied. In terms of visual appeal, there are indications that using graphics/visuals that are relevant to the message which is attempting to be sent, yet less visual graphics to be applied with initial emails are more effective in-turn creating a relatively personal feel to the email. In terms of language, the style is the main factor in determining how captivating the email is.

    <p>Dr. Dave Chaffey, an author on marketing topics, has suggested that successful digital marketing strategies have do digital marketing planning (DMP), which is a three-stage approach: Opportunity, Strategy, and Action. This generic strategic approach often has phases of situation review, goal setting, strategy formulation, resource allocation and monitoring.<sup id="cite_ref-isbn_0273746227_90-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-isbn_0273746227-90"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>90<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

    </p><p>To seize the opportunity, the firm should summarize its current customers' personas and purchase journey from this they are able to deduce their digital marketing capability.

    <p>To create a planned digital strategy, the company must review their digital proposition (what you are offering to consumers) and communicate it using digital customer targeting techniques.
