<h1>Web devlopment ?</h1>
<p>Web development is the process of creating, maintaining, and improving websites and web applications. It involves designing the user interface, programming the website, and managing the database. 
    How it works
    Web development is typically broken down into three areas:
    <br>
    <h2>Front-end development</h2>
    The process of designing the user interface and experience (UI/UX) of a website.<br> 
   <mark>Front-end developers focus on making the website visually appealing,</mark>  easy to use, and functional across different devices and browsers. 
    <br>

   <h2>Back-end development</h2>
    The process of working on the server-side software of a website. Back-end developers focus on how the website works, including databases, logic, architecture, and servers. 
    <u>Full-stack development</u>
    The process of developing both the front-end and back-end of a website or web application. Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end development. 
   <br>
    <h2> Web development life cycle</h2>
    The web development life cycle typically includes the following stages:
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Gathering information</li>
    <li>Planning</li>
    <li>Design and layout</li>
    <li>Content creation</li>
    <li>Development</li>
    <li>Testing</li>

</ul> 
</p>
<p><h2>NOTE:</h2><mark>
Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).<br>
[1]Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
